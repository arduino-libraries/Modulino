/*
  Heart Animation Sketch
  
  This is the default sketch that comes
  shipped with every UNO R4 WiFi board.

  After the animation (a heart) is complete,
  the built-in LED blinks infinitely.

  No additional circuit required.

// include the LED Matrix library from the Uno R4 core:

  // start the matrix

  // turn on autoscroll to avoid calling next() to show the next frame; the paramenter is in milliseconds
  // matrix.autoscroll(300);

  //play the animation on the matrix
  matrix.play(true);
